## Description

The webpage is a financial website using stock screeners and also displays financial news related to the top companies in the world. Users can add and remove stocks to and from their watchlist so that their favorite stocks can be saved in the sidebar. When the user clicks on or searches for a stock, the stock chart, information, and news are displayed.

We used two different APIs to pull data about stock financial ratios and financial news. The stock data acts as the aside on the web page and the main content carries the financial news. The news updates everytime a user searches a stock and gets news that is relevant to the stock searched.
